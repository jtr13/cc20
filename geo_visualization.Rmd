#Translation of visualization related to geo data

My partner and I wished to contribute to the community by translating the following paper into
Chinese. This paper was published in 2019 by several scholars from Italy and it was aimed to
encourage experts and non-experts to explore and to interpret the Spatio-Temporal ground
deformation pattern in urban areas by the method it described. To fulfill this goal, two
visualization applications were introduced. One was to visualize the mean deformation velocity
map and the other one was to animate the cumulative deformation time series. Both
visualizations were overlaid on a three-dimensional map and could be accessed via a free and
open Web source (FOSS). My partner and I were inspired by this paper, not only because a new
method was introduced, but also kept reminding us that data visualization could be and should be
interpretable for non-experts and not for experts alone.

This paper has been a useful resource for us, and we hope its translation would be helpful for our
classmates as well. 

The original paper could be found on [isprs website](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W14-135-2019). Our translation can be found on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/qpjoy1997/STAT5702_CC_Group29).
