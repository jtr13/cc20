# My name is Megan and I'm a 4th year PhD student in the Psychology Department and also a Masters student in the Statistics Depatment. For my community contribution, I made a video on a topic that many of my peers in statistics classes tend to ask me about: the replication crisis in psychology. The video can be found on Youtube: https://youtu.be/ReNwd7svJe4.
