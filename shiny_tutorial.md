# Plotting interactive graphs with Shiny

Yifei Chen and Zujun Peng



For our community contribution project, we create a tutorial aiming to show Shiny applications in producing interactive plots of some widely used plot formats we have learned in class, including histogram, scatter plot, bar chart, and so on. We divide our tutorial into five parts: introduction, basic structure, displaying continuous variables, displaying categorical variables, and displaying Likert data. In our Shiny app, users can interactively make plots of their chosen variables and parameters. 

More details about Shiny could be found on the official website: https://shiny.rstudio.com/.

**Notice that we run this tutorial on shinyapps.io. It may take a while for the website to display some interactive plots or reflect the changes you make. Thank you!**
