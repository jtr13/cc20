# Tableau intro tutorial explained with proset2

Yue Wang

For the community contribution project, I will briefly introduce Tableau, the major features of this product, and other relevant products that are used in a different setting. I will introduce structure of the interfaces, importation of data, the supported files of data, supported data types, how to build worksheets and an interactive dashboard. 

I’ll use the Problem1 from Problem Set 2 to do the demo. This problem includes recoding of factor levels, vertical/horizontal bar chart, and horizontal bar chart of proportion. Although it only covers bar chart, I believe this will be a great first step to learn about how Tableau generally works. After doing the demo, I’ll draw a comparison with R and Excel and reemphasize the context of using Tableau.
