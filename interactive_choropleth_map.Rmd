# d3.js Intereactive Choropleth Map

Heather Zhu

There are many practical tools to make visualizations. In addition to using `R` as we learned in class, `D3.js` is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.

I uploaded an example of creating an interactive choropleth map using `D3.js` and `geojson` in this [GitHub Page](https://github.com/hz825/interactive-choropleth-map).  
Here's the rendered interactive map on [heroku](https://interactive-choropleth-map.herokuapp.com/).   
To make the code easier to understand, I created a walkthrough [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/h0W5fchLbwI).
