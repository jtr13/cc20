# Ipywidget example walkthrough video

Weiyao Xie

Ipywidget can be used to implement html widgets in jupyter notebook which enable easier interactions with dataset. I want to do this video tutorial because I found the [official documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was not very intuitive and lacked example demonstration.

The video tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/WI2WMYJBHOU). Hope this can be helpful.
