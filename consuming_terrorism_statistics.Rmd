# Consuming terrorism statistics

Michelle Strayer
For the community contribution project, I presented a lecture on how to 
critically consume statistics on terrorism.  This lecture was broken down 
into several parts, including a discussion of why critical consumption is
necessary, how media presentation of terrorism statistics shapes (and distorts)
our understanding of current events, barriers in studying terrorism, and 
suggestions on responsibly consuming terrorism statistics from the lenses of
political science, data science, statistics, and mass media.
